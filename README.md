Here is another project that aims to introduce me and improve my skills in html and css. This is a simple one-page blog with 4 parts: Me in short, Special facts about me, My best trip and my goals.
In order to add images to the words, a picture of me, a youtube link and a description of where I went are given. Enjoy it.
