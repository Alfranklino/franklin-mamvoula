            <h1 id="T1">Me in brief</h1>
            <p class="plaintext">I'm <strong>Franklin MAMVOULA (AlCom)</strong>. I live in Scarborough, ON. Three weeks ago, I was in Cameroon as a Teacher 
                at the university. My wife, my son and I traveled here because we love Canada. Due to the weather, 
                cultural diversity and tech opportunities we decided to settle at Toronto.</p>
            
            <h1 id="T2">Special facts about Me</h1>
            <p class="plaintext">I really like programming languages and design. All that relates to computers stirs my curiosity.</p>  
            <p class="plaintext">In 1993, due to her studies my mum went to Montreal, and came back in cameroon with a pc running WIN 3.1. 
                It was my first experience with computers and also with Canada, and it changed my life forever.</p> 
            <p class="plaintext">I'm good at learning and teaching, but my secret talent is to 
                know how to <strong>surround myself with the best people.</strong></p>
            
            <h1 id="T3">My best travel Experience</h1>
            <p class="plaintext">With some friends, we went climb a mountain in my country. It's called Mt <a href="https://www.partirvoirlemonde.com/2017/04/24/faire-une-randonn%C3%A9e-au-mont-manengouba-au-cameroun/">Manengouba</a>. It was a great moment of communion with nature. There, I saw a lake that has the shape of Africa's Continent. What a curiousity!</p>
